          In the name of his murdered parents, Bruce Wayne wages eternal war on
          the criminals of Gotham City. He is vengeance. He is the night. He is
          Batman. One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world,
          Batman has dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a war on all
          criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him
          when he was just a child. Since that tragic night, he has trained his
          body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super
          Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most
          armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of his fellow DC Super
          Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman,
          Incorporated.

          A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne’s double life affords him
          the comfort of a life without financial worry, a loyal
          butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the
          ancient network of caves beneath his family’s sprawling estate. By
          night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape
          and pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops
          of Gotham City.
